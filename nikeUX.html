                <p> 
                  As a personal project, I aimed to enhance the online shopping experience for sports and lifestyle enthusiasts through the design of the Puma shopping app. Drawing inspiration from Puma’s energetic brand identity, I sought to create a user-friendly app that reflects both style and functionality, catering to the needs of modern consumers.

The app needed to facilitate easy navigation, personalized shopping, and an engaging interface that resonates with the brand's audience. The challenge was to balance visual appeal with efficiency in the shopping process.
