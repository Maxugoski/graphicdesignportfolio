              <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p> 
                  In 2022, I worked with Samas Makeover, a beauty brand specializing in makeup and nail services. My friend, who is passionate about enhancing beauty through professional makeovers, approached me to create an eye-catching poster that would effectively promote her brand
                </p>

                  <h5> Project Brief</h5>
                    <p>
                      The goal was to design a visually stunning poster that showcases the services offered by Samas Makeover, attracting potential clients and highlighting the brand's expertise in beauty makeovers. The design needed to convey elegance and professionalism while reflecting the vibrant nature of the beauty industry.
                    </p>
                  <h5>Goals</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Develop an attractive poster that highlights the key services of Samas Makeover.</li>
                    <li> Use striking visuals and typography to draw attention and inspire potential clients.</li>
                    <li> Clearly present service offerings and contact information.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>Process</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Research and Inspiration: I explored various beauty and salon posters to identify design elements that resonate with the target audience. This helped inform the concept for Samas Makeover’s branding.</li>
                    <li>Content Integration: I ensured that the poster included essential details, such as service offerings and the brand name, making them prominent and easy to read.</li>
                    <li>Visual Design: I selected a luxurious color palette and striking imagery that captures the essence of beauty and elegance. The typography was chosen to reflect a modern and stylish aesthetic.</li>
                    <li> Feedback and Iteration: I presented the initial design to Samas Makeover for feedback, making adjustments based on her input to ensure the final product aligned with her vision.</li>
                  </ul>

                    <h5>Unique Solution</h5>
                    <p>
                      The final poster features a captivating design that showcases the beauty and elegance associated with Samas Makeover. The use of high-quality images and bold typography effectively communicates the brand’s offerings, while the overall layout draws the viewer's attention. This approach not only highlights the services but also establishes a strong brand identity.
                    </p>

                  <h5>Tools Used</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Adobe Photoshop: For graphic design, image editing and enhancements.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Experience Gained</h5>
                  <p>
                    This project was an exciting opportunity to collaborate with a friend and contribute to her brand's growth in the beauty industry. I hope the poster serves as an effective promotional tool for Samas Makeover, attracting clients and showcasing her talent.
