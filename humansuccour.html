              <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p> 
                  In February 2024, I collaborated with Human Succour, a caregiving NGO based in Pittsburgh, USA, to create a promotional poster. Human Succour is dedicated to providing compassionate care and support for individuals in need, focusing on enhancing their well-being and health.
                </p>

                  <h5> Project Brief</h5>
                    <p>
                      The objective was to design a poster that effectively communicates the services offered by Human Succour while resonating with their target audience. The design needed to convey a sense of care, professionalism, and warmth, encouraging potential clients to reach out for assistance.
                    </p>
                  <h5>Goals</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Create a visually appealing poster that highlights the key services of Human Succour.</li>
                    <li> Use engaging visuals and typography to enhance clarity and appeal.</li>
                    <li> Ensure the contact information and service details are prominently displayed.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>Process</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Research and Concept Development: I explored effective designs used in the healthcare and caregiving sectors, focusing on elements that evoke trust and compassion. This informed the design direction to align with Human Succour’s mission.</li>
                    <li>Content Integration: I incorporated the essential details, including service offerings, contact information, and location, ensuring they were clear and easy to read.</li>
                    <li> Visual Design: I selected a soothing color palette and engaging imagery that reflects the caring nature of the services provided. The typography was chosen to enhance readability while conveying a friendly tone.</li>
                    <li> Feedback and Iteration: I shared the initial design with the Human Succour team for feedback, making necessary adjustments to ensure the final product met their expectations and effectively conveyed their message.</li>
                  </ul>

                    <h5>Unique Solution</h5>
                    <p>
                      The final poster features a calming and inviting design that captures the essence of Human Succour’s caregiving services. The combination of friendly imagery and clear typography emphasizes their commitment to client well-being. The layout ensures that essential information is easily accessible, encouraging potential clients to reach out for assistance.
                    </p>

                  <h5>Tools Used</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Adobe Illustrator: For creating graphic elements and layout.</li>
                    <li> Adobe Photoshop: For image editing and enhancements.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Experience Gained</h5>
                  <p>
                    This project allowed me to contribute to a meaningful cause, utilizing design to promote the vital services offered by Human Succour. I hope the poster effectively resonates with the community and encourages individuals to seek the care they need.
