              <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p> 
                  In 2023, I collaborated with WomenAid Collective (WACOL), a prominent human rights NGO, to create a social media poster aimed at promoting gender equality. WACOL is dedicated to advocating for women's rights and addressing issues of discrimination and inequality. Inspired by their mission, I sought to design an illustration that effectively communicates the importance of gender equality as a fundamental human right.

                  <h5> Project Brief</h5>
                    <p>
                      The objective was to create a visually engaging social media poster that highlights the significance of gender equality. The design needed to resonate with a diverse audience, conveying WACOL’s message clearly and compellingly. The challenge was to balance informative content with an appealing aesthetic to encourage sharing and engagement on social media platforms.

                  <h5>Goals</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Design an impactful poster that promotes the message of gender equality.</li>
                    <li> Use engaging visuals and typography to enhance readability and appeal.</li>
                    <li> Ensure the design aligns with WACOL’s branding and mission.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>Process</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Research and Concept Development: I gathered insights on effective social media campaigns related to human rights and gender equality, identifying key elements that resonate with audiences.</li>
                    <li>Content Integration: I incorporated the text provided by WACOL, ensuring it clearly communicated the message while remaining concise and impactful.</li>
                    <li>Visual Design: I created illustrations and selected a color palette that reflects WACOL’s identity, incorporating symbols of gender equality, such as the gender symbols and inclusive imagery.</li>
                    <li>Feedback and Iteration: I shared the initial design with WACOL for feedback, making adjustments to ensure the final product met their expectations and effectively conveyed the message.</li>
                  </ul>

                    <h5>Unique Solution</h5>
                    <p>
                      The final poster features a vibrant illustration that combines gender symbols with engaging visuals, emphasizing the importance of gender equality. The concise text outlines the fundamental human right of gender equality, ensuring that the message is clear and memorable. This approach not only aligns with WACOL’s mission but also encourages viewers to reflect on the importance of equality.
                    </p>

                  <h5>Tools Used</h5>
